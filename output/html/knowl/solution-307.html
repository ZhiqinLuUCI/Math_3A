<p>The graphs are NOT equal, since <span class="process-math">\(\{a,d\} \in E_1\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\{a,d\} \notin E_2\text{.}\)</span> However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and same number of edges, they <em class="emphasis">might</em> be isomorphic (this is not enough in most cases, but it is a good start).</p>
<p>We can try to build an isomorphism. How about we say <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(b) = c\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(c) = d\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(d) = a\text{.}\)</span> This is definitely a bijection, but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it <em class="emphasis">respects the edge relation</em>. In <span class="process-math">\(G_1\text{,}\)</span> vertices <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are connected by an edge. In <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(b) = c\)</span> are connected by an edge. So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges. The edge <span class="process-math">\(\{a,c\}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G_1\)</span> corresponds to <span class="process-math">\(\{f(a),
f(c)\} = \{b,d\}\text{,}\)</span> but here we have a problem. There is no edge between <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is NOT an isomorphism.</p>
<p>Not all hope is lost, however. Just because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all. We can try again. At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.</p>

<p>Alternatively, notice that in <span class="process-math">\(G_1\text{,}\)</span> the vertex <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is adjacent to every other vertex. In <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{,}\)</span> there is also a vertex with this property: <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> So build the bijection <span class="process-math">\(g:V_1 \to V_2\)</span> by defining <span class="process-math">\(g(a) = c\)</span> to start with. Next, where should we send <span class="process-math">\(b\text{?}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(G_1\text{,}\)</span> the vertex <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is only adjacent to vertex <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> There is exactly one vertex like this in <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{,}\)</span> namely <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> So let <span class="process-math">\(g(b) = d\text{.}\)</span> As for the last two, in this example, we have a free choice: let <span class="process-math">\(g(c) = b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(d) = a\)</span> (switching these would be fine as well).</p>
<p>We should check that this really is an isomorphism. It is definitely a bijection. We must make sure that the edges are respected. The four edges in <span class="process-math">\(G_1\)</span> are</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Under the proposed isomorphism these become</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\{g(a), g(b)\}, \{g(a), g(c)\}, \{g(a), g(d)\}, \{g(c), g(d)\}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\{c,d\}, \{c,b\}, \{c,a\}, \{b,a\}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which are precisely the edges in <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is an isomorphism, so <span class="process-math">\(G_1 \cong G_2\)</span></p>
