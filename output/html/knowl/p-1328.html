<p>Finding the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3 is harder. Think about how such a string could start. The first bit must be either a 0 or a 1. In the first case (the string starts with a 0), we must then decide on four more bits. To have a total of three 1's, among those four remaining bits there must be three 1's. To count all of these strings, we must include all 4-bit strings of weight 3. In the second case (the string starts with a 1), we still have four bits to choose, but now only two of them can be 1's, so we should look at all the 4-bit strings of weight 2. So the strings in <span class="process-math">\(\B^5_3\)</span> all have the form <span class="process-math">\(1\B^4_2\)</span> (that is, a 1 followed by a string from <span class="process-math">\(\B^4_2\)</span>) or <span class="process-math">\(0\B^4_3\text{.}\)</span> These two sets are disjoint, so we can use the additive principle:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
|\B^5_3| = |\B^4_2| + |\B^4_3|\text{.}
\end{equation*}
