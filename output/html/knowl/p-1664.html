<p>The Stanley Cup is decided in a best of 7 tournament between two teams. In how many ways can your team win? Let's answer this question two ways:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How many of the 7 games does your team need to win? How many ways can this happen?</p></li>
<li><p>What if the tournament goes all 7 games? So you win the last game. How many ways can the first 6 games go down?</p></li>
<li><p>What if the tournament goes just 6 games? How many ways can this happen? What about 5 games? 4 games?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the two different ways to compute the number of ways your team can win? Write down an equation involving binomial coefficients (that is, <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span>'s). What pattern in Pascal's triangle is this an example of?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Generalize. What if the rules changed and you played a best of <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> tournament (5 wins required)? What if you played an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> game tournament with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> wins required to be named champion?</p></li>
