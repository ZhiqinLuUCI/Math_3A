<p>This is a big idea. Thinking about a problem <em class="emphasis">inductively</em> can give new insight into the problem. For example, to really understand the stamp problem, you should think about how any amount of postage (greater than 28 cents) can be made (this is non-inductive reasoning) and also how the ways in which postage can be made <em class="emphasis">changes</em> as the amount increases (inductive reasoning). When you are asked to provide a proof by induction, you are being asked to think about the problem <em class="emphasis">dynamically</em>; how does increasing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> change the problem?</p>
