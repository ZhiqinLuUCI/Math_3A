<p>We must use the three games (call them 1, 2, 3) as the domain and the 5 friends (a,b,c,d,e) as the codomain (otherwise the function would not be defined for the whole domain when a friend didn't get any game). So how many functions are there with domain <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,3\}\)</span> and codomain <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{?}\)</span> The answer to this is <span class="process-math">\(5^3=125\text{,}\)</span> since we can assign any of 5 elements to be the image of 1, any of 5 elements to be the image of 2 and any of 5 elements to be the image of 3.</p>
<p>But this is not the correct answer to our counting problem, because one of these functions is <span class="process-math">\(f= \twoline{1\amp 2\amp 3}{a\amp a\amp a}\text{;}\)</span> one friend can get more than one game. What we really need to do is count <em class="emphasis">injective</em> functions. This gives <span class="process-math">\(P(5,3) = 60\)</span> functions, which is the answer to our counting question.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_advPIE.html#LZo" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
