<p>Before solving the problem, here is a wrong answer: You might guess that the answer should be <span class="process-math">\(4^7\)</span> because for each of the 7 cookies, there are 4 choices of kids to which you can give the cookie. This is reasonable, but wrong. To see why, consider a few possible outcomes: we could assign the first six cookies to kid A, and the seventh cookie to kid B. Another outcome would assign the first cookie to kid B and the six remaining cookies to kid A. Both outcomes are included in the <span class="process-math">\(4^7\)</span> answer. But for our counting problem, both outcomes are really the same â€“ kid A gets six cookies and kid B gets one cookie.</p>
