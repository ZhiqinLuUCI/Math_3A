<p>We will give two different proofs of this fact. The first will be very similar to the previous example (counting subsets). The second proof is a little slicker, using lattice paths.</p>
<article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Consider the question: “How many pizzas can you make using <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> toppings when there are <span class="process-math">\(2n\)</span> toppings to choose from?”</p>
<p>Answer 1: There are <span class="process-math">\(2n\)</span> toppings, from which you must choose <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> This can be done in <span class="process-math">\({2n \choose n}\)</span> ways.</p>
<p>Answer 2: Divide the toppings into two groups of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> toppings (perhaps <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> meats and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> veggies). Any choice of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> toppings must include some number from the first group and some number from the second group. Consider each possible number of meat toppings separately:</p>
<p>0 meats: <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 0}{n \choose n}\text{,}\)</span> since you need to choose 0 of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> meats and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> veggies.</p>
<p>1 meat: <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 1}{n \choose n-1}\text{,}\)</span> since you need 1 of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> meats so <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> veggies.</p>
<p>2 meats: <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 2}{n \choose n-2}\text{.}\)</span> Choose 2 meats and the remaining <span class="process-math">\(n-2\)</span> toppings from the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> veggies.</p>
<p>And so on. The last case is <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> meats, which can be done in <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n}{n \choose 0}\)</span> ways.</p>
<p>Thus the total number of pizzas possible is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
{n \choose 0}{n \choose n} + {n \choose 1}{n \choose n-1} + {n \choose 2}{n \choose n-2} + \cdots + {n \choose n}{n \choose 0}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is not quite the left-hand side … yet. Notice that <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n} = {n \choose 0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n-1} = {n  \choose 1}\)</span> and so on, by the identity in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-symmetry-formula.html" title="Example 1.4.4">Example 1.4.4</a>. Thus we do indeed get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/example-symmetry-formula.html">
\begin{equation*}
{n \choose 0}^2 + {n \choose 1}^2 + {n \choose 2}^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n}^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since these two answers are answers to the same question, they must be equal, and thus</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
{n \choose 0}^2 + {n \choose 1}^2 + {n \choose 2}^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n}^2 = {2n \choose n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div></article><p>For an alternative proof, we use lattice paths. This is reasonable to consider because the right-hand side of the identity reminds us of the number of paths from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Consider the question: How many lattice paths are there from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\text{?}\)</span></p>
<p>Answer 1: We must travel <span class="process-math">\(2n\)</span> steps, and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> of them must be in the up direction. Thus there are <span class="process-math">\({2n \choose n}\)</span> paths.</p>
<p>Answer 2: Note that any path from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> must cross the line <span class="process-math">\(x + y = n\text{.}\)</span> That is, any path must pass through exactly one of the points: <span class="process-math">\((0,n)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((1,n-1)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((2,n-2)\text{,}\)</span> …, <span class="process-math">\((n, 0)\text{.}\)</span> For example, this is what happens in the case <span class="process-math">\(n = 4\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:30%;margin-right:30%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/lattice-paths-comb-proof.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></div></div>
<p>How many paths pass through <span class="process-math">\((0,n)\text{?}\)</span> To get to that point, you must travel <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> units, and <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> of them are to the right, so there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 0}\)</span> ways to get to <span class="process-math">\((0,n)\text{.}\)</span> From <span class="process-math">\((0,n)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> takes <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> steps, and <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> of them are up. So there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 0}\)</span> ways to get from <span class="process-math">\((0,n)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\text{.}\)</span> Therefore there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 0}{n \choose 0}\)</span> paths from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> through the point <span class="process-math">\((0,n)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>What about through <span class="process-math">\((1,n-1)\text{.}\)</span> There are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 1}\)</span> paths to get there (<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> steps, 1 to the right) and <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 1}\)</span> paths to complete the journey to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> steps, <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> up). So there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 1}{n \choose 1}\)</span> paths from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> through <span class="process-math">\((1,n-1)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>In general, to get to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> through the point <span class="process-math">\((k,n-k)\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> paths to the midpoint and then <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> paths from the midpoint to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\text{.}\)</span> So there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}{n \choose k}\)</span> paths from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> through <span class="process-math">\((k, n-k)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>All together then the total paths from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((n,n)\)</span> passing through exactly one of these midpoints is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
{n \choose 0}^2 + {n \choose 1}^2 + {n \choose 2}^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n}^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since these two answers are answers to the same question, they must be equal, and thus</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
{n \choose 0}^2 + {n \choose 1}^2 + {n \choose 2}^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n}^2 = {2n \choose n}\text{.}
