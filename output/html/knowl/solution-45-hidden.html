<p>The initial condition is <span class="process-math">\(f(0) = 3\text{.}\)</span> To get <span class="process-math">\(f(n+1)\)</span> we would double the number of snails in the terrarium the previous year, which is given by <span class="process-math">\(f(n)\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f(n+1) = 2f(n)\text{.}\)</span> The full recursive definition contains both of these, and would be written,</p>

<p>We are told that on day 0 you can do 7 push-ups, so <span class="process-math">\(g(0) = 7\text{.}\)</span> The number of push-ups you can do on day <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> is 2 more than the number you can do on day <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> which is given by <span class="process-math">\(g(n)\text{.}\)</span> Thus</p>

<p>Here <span class="process-math">\(h(0) = 1\text{.}\)</span> To get the recurrence relation, think about how you can get <span class="process-math">\(h(n+1) = (n+1)!\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(h(n) = n!\text{.}\)</span> If you write out both of these as products, you see that <span class="process-math">\((n+1)!\)</span> is just like <span class="process-math">\(n!\)</span> except you have one more term in the product, an extra <span class="process-math">\(n+1\text{.}\)</span> So we have,</p>
