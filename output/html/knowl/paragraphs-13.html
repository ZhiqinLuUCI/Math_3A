<p>There is another interesting way we might consider coloring edges, quite different from what we have discussed so far. What if we colored every edge of a graph either red or blue. Can we do so without, say, creating a <em class="emphasis">monochromatic</em>  triangle (i.e., an all red or all blue triangle)? Certainly for some graphs the answer is yes. Try doing so for <span class="process-math">\(K_4\text{.}\)</span> What about <span class="process-math">\(K_5\text{?}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(K_6\text{?}\)</span> How far can we go?</p>
<p>The problem above is not too difficult and is a fun exercise. We could extend the question in a variety of ways. What if we had three colors? What if we were trying to avoid other graphs. Surprisingly, very little is known about these questions. For example, we know that you need to go up to <span class="process-math">\(K_{17}\)</span> in order to force a monochromatic triangle using three colors, but nobody knows how big you need to go with more colors. Similarly, we know that using two colors <span class="process-math">\(K_{18}\)</span> is the smallest graph that forces a monochromatic copy of <span class="process-math">\(K_4\text{,}\)</span> but the best we have to force a monochromatic <span class="process-math">\(K_{5}\)</span> is a range, somewhere from <span class="process-math">\(K_{43}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(K_{49}\text{.}\)</span> If you are interested in these sorts of questions, this area of graph theory is called Ramsey theory.
