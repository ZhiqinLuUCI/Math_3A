<p>Doing this directly would be difficult, but we can use the matching condition to help. Construct a graph <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> with 13 vertices in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> each representing one of the 13 card values, and 13 vertices in the set <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> each representing one of the 13 piles. Draw an edge between a vertex <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> to a vertex <span class="process-math">\(b \in B\)</span> if a card with value <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is in the pile <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Notice that we are just looking for a matching of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{;}\)</span> each value needs to be found in the piles exactly once.</p>
<p>We will have a matching if the matching condition holds. Given any set of card values (a set <span class="process-math">\(S \subseteq A\)</span>) we must show that <span class="process-math">\(|N(S)| \ge |S|\text{.}\)</span> That is, the number of piles that contain those values is at least the number of different values. But what if it wasn't? Say <span class="process-math">\(|S| = k\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(|N(S)| \lt k\text{,}\)</span> then we would have fewer than <span class="process-math">\(4k\)</span> different cards in those piles (since each pile contains 4 cards). But there are <span class="process-math">\(4k\)</span> cards with the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> different values, so at least one of these cards must be in another pile, a contradiction. Thus the matching condition holds, so there is a matching, as required.</p>
