<p>The proof will be by strong induction.</p>

<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.” We will show that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Base case: <span class="process-math">\(1 = 2^0\)</span> is a power of 2, so <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true.</p>
<p>Inductive case: Suppose <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(k \lt n\text{.}\)</span> Now if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is a power of 2, we are done. If not, let <span class="process-math">\(2^x\)</span> be the largest power of 2 strictly less than <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Consider <span class="process-math">\(n - 2^x\text{,}\)</span> which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2^x\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(n-2^x\)</span> is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be <span class="process-math">\(2^x\text{,}\)</span> so the together with <span class="process-math">\(2^x\)</span> we have written <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> as the sum of distinct powers of 2.</p>
<p>Therefore, by the principle of (strong) mathematical induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</span></p></article>
