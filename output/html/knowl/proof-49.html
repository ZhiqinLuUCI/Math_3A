<p>Recall that all the faces of a regular polyhedron are identical regular polygons, and that each vertex has the same degree. Consider four cases, depending on the type of regular polygon.</p>
<p>Case 1: Each face is a triangle. Let <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> be the number of faces. There are then <span class="process-math">\(3f/2\)</span> edges. Using Euler's formula we have <span class="process-math">\(v - 3f/2 + f = 2\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(v = 2 + f/2\text{.}\)</span> Now each vertex has the same degree, say <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> So the number of edges is also <span class="process-math">\(kv/2\text{.}\)</span> Putting this together gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
e = \frac{3f}{2} = \frac{k(2+f/2)}{2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which says</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{6f}{4+f}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Both <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must be positive integers. Note that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{6f}{4+f}\)</span> is an increasing function for positive <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> bounded above by a horizontal asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(k=6\text{.}\)</span> Thus the only possible values for <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> are 3, 4, and 5. Each of these are possible. To get <span class="process-math">\(k = 3\text{,}\)</span> we need <span class="process-math">\(f = 4\)</span> (this is the tetrahedron).  For <span class="process-math">\(k = 4\)</span> we take <span class="process-math">\(f = 8\)</span> (the octahedron).  For <span class="process-math">\(k = 5\)</span> take <span class="process-math">\(f = 20\)</span> (the icosahedron).  Thus there are exactly three regular polyhedra with triangles for faces.</p>
<p>Case 2: Each face is a square. Now we have <span class="process-math">\(e = 4f/2 = 2f\text{.}\)</span> Using Euler's formula we get <span class="process-math">\(v = 2 + f\text{,}\)</span> and counting edges using the degree <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of each vertex gives us</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
e = 2f = \frac{k(2+f)}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solving for <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{4f}{2+f} = \frac{8f}{4+2f}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is again an increasing function, but this time the horizontal asymptote is at <span class="process-math">\(k = 4\text{,}\)</span> so the only possible value that <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> could take is 3. This produces 6 faces, and we have a cube. There is only one regular polyhedron with square faces.</p>
<p>Case 3: Each face is a pentagon. We perform the same calculation as above, this time getting <span class="process-math">\(e = 5f/2\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(v = 2 + 3f/2\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
e = \frac{5f}{2} = \frac{k(2+3f/2)}{2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{10f}{4+3f}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now the horizontal asymptote is at <span class="process-math">\(\frac{10}{3}\text{.}\)</span> This is less than 4, so we can only hope of making <span class="process-math">\(k = 3\text{.}\)</span> We can do so by using 12 pentagons, getting the dodecahedron.  This is the only regular polyhedron with pentagons as faces.</p>
<p>Case 4: Each face is an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-gon with <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 6\text{.}\)</span> Following the same procedure as above, we deduce that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{2nf}{4+(n-2)f}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which will be increasing to a horizontal asymptote of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2n}{n-2}\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(n = 6\text{,}\)</span> this asymptote is at <span class="process-math">\(k = 3\text{.}\)</span> Any larger value of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> will give an even smaller asymptote. Therefore no regular polyhedra exist with faces larger than pentagons.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-21-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_planar.html#kJP" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
