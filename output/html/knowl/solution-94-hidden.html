<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><p>We do NOT want to try to list all of these out. However, if we did, we would need to pick a letter to write down first. There are 6 choices for that letter. For each choice of first letter, there are 5 choices for the second letter (we cannot repeat the first letter; we are rearranging letters and only have one of each), and for each of those, there are 4 choices for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2 choices for the fifth and finally only 1 choice for the last letter. So there are <span class="process-math">\(6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 720\)</span> permutations of the 6 letters.</p></div></body>
