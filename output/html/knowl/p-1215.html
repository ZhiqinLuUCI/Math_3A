<p>To determine how many elements are in at least one of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> we add up all the elements in each of those sets. However, when we do that, any element in both <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is counted twice. Also, each element in both <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is counted twice, as are elements in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> so we take each of those out of our sum once. But now what about the elements which are in <span class="process-math">\(A \cap B \cap C\)</span> (in all three sets)? We added them in three times, but also removed them three times. They have not yet been counted. Thus we add those elements back in at the end.</p>
