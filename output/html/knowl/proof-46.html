<p>We will give a proof by induction on the number of vertices in the tree.  That is, we will prove that every tree with <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> vertices has exactly <span class="process-math">\(v-1\)</span> edges, and then use induction to show this is true for all <span class="process-math">\(v \ge 1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>For the base case, consider all trees with <span class="process-math">\(v = 1\)</span> vertices.  There is only one such tree: the graph with a single isolated vertex.  This graph has <span class="process-math">\(e = 0\)</span> edges, so we see that <span class="process-math">\(e = v-1\)</span> as needed.</p>
<p>Now for the inductive case, fix <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 1\)</span> and assume that all trees with <span class="process-math">\(v=k\)</span> vertices have exactly <span class="process-math">\(e=k-1\)</span> edges.  Now consider an arbitrary tree <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(v = k+1\)</span> vertices.  By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop-leaves-in-trees.html" title="Proposition 4.2.3">PropositionÂ 4.2.3</a>, <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has a vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> of degree one.  Let <span class="process-math">\(T'\)</span> be the tree resulting from removing <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> (together with its incident edge).  Since we removed a leaf, <span class="process-math">\(T'\)</span> is still a tree (the unique paths between pairs of vertices in <span class="process-math">\(T'\)</span> are the same as the unique paths between them in <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span>).</p>
<p>Now <span class="process-math">\(T'\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> vertices, so by the inductive hypothesis, has <span class="process-math">\(k-1\)</span> edges.  What can we say about <span class="process-math">\(T\text{?}\)</span>  Well, it has one more edge than <span class="process-math">\(T'\text{,}\)</span> so it has <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> edges.  But this is exactly what we wanted: <span class="process-math">\(v=k+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e=k\)</span> so indeed <span class="process-math">\(e = v-1\text{.}\)</span>  This completes the inductive case, and the proof.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_trees.html#Lqh" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
