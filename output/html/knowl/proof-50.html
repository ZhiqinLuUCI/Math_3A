<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement, “every connected planar graph containing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> edges satisfies <span class="process-math">\(v - n + f = 2\text{.}\)</span>” We will show <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Base case: there is only one graph with zero edges, namely a single isolated vertex. In this case <span class="process-math">\(v = 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e = 0\text{,}\)</span> so Euler's formula holds.</p>
<p>Inductive case: Suppose <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for some arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 0\text{.}\)</span> Now consider an arbitrary graph containing <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> edges (and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> vertices and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> faces). No matter what this graph looks like, we can remove a single edge to get a graph with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> edges which we can apply the inductive hypothesis to.</p>
<p>There are two cases: either the graph contains a cycle or it does not. If the graph contains a cycle, then pick an edge that is part of this cycle, and remove it.  This will not disconnect the graph, and will decrease the number of faces by 1 (since the edge was bordering two distinct faces).  So by the inductive hypothesis we will have <span class="process-math">\(v - k + f-1 = 2\text{.}\)</span> Adding the edge back will give <span class="process-math">\(v - (k+1) + f = 2\)</span> as needed.</p>
<p>If the graph does not contain a cycle, then it is a tree, so has a vertex of degree 1.  Then we can pick the edge to remove to be incident to such a degree 1 vertex. In this case, also remove that vertex. The smaller graph will now satisfy <span class="process-math">\(v-1 - k + f = 2\)</span> by the induction hypothesis (removing the edge and vertex did not reduce the number of faces). Adding the edge and vertex back gives <span class="process-math">\(v - (k+1) + f = 2\text{,}\)</span> as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, Euler's formula holds for all planar graphs.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_planar.html#UjQ" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
