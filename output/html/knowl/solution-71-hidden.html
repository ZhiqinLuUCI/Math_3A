<p>Remember that a function sends each element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain. To determine a function, we just need to specify the image of each element in the domain. Where can we send 1? There are 4 choices. Where can we send 2? Again, 4 choices. What we have here is 5 “events” (picking the image of an element in the domain) each of which can happen in 4 ways (the choices for that image). Thus there are <span class="process-math">\(4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 4^5\)</span> functions.</p>
<p>This is more than just an example of how we can use the multiplicative principle in a particular counting question. What we have here is a general interpretation of certain applications of the multiplicative principle using rigorously defined mathematical objects: functions. Whenever we have a counting question that asks for the number of outcomes of a repeated event, we can interpret that as asking for the number of functions from <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\ldots, n\}\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of times the event is repeated) to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\ldots,k\}\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the number of ways that event can occur).</p>
