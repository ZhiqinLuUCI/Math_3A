<p>You have a bunch of chips which come in five different colors: red, blue, green, purple and yellow.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>How many different two-chip stacks can you make if the bottom chip must be red or blue? Explain your answer using both the additive and multiplicative principles.</p></li>
<li><p>How many different three-chip stacks can you make if the bottom chip must be red or blue and the top chip must be green, purple or yellow? How does this problem relate to the previous one?</p></li>
<li><p>How many different three-chip stacks are there in which no color is repeated? What about four-chip stacks?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you wanted to take three different colored chips and put them in your pocket. How many different choices do you have? What if you wanted four different colored chips? How do these problems relate to the previous one?</p></li>
