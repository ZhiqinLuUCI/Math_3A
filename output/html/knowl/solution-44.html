<p>The rule says that <span class="process-math">\(f(6) = f(5) + 11\)</span> (we are using <span class="process-math">\(6 = n+1\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(n = 5\)</span>). We don't know what <span class="process-math">\(f(5)\)</span> is though. Well, we know that <span class="process-math">\(f(5) = f(4) + 9\text{.}\)</span> So we need to compute <span class="process-math">\(f(4)\text{,}\)</span> which will require knowing <span class="process-math">\(f(3)\text{,}\)</span> which will require <span class="process-math">\(f(2)\text{,}\)</span>â€¦ will it ever end?</p>
<p>Yes! In fact, this process will always end because we have <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span> as our domain, so there is a least element. And we gave the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(0)\)</span> explicitly, so we are good. In fact, we might decide to work up to <span class="process-math">\(f(6)\)</span> instead of working down from <span class="process-math">\(f(6)\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
f(1) = \amp f(0) + 1 = \amp 0 + 1 = 1\\
f(2) = \amp f(1) + 3 = \amp 1 + 3 = 4\\
f(3) = \amp f(2) + 5 = \amp 4 + 5 = 9\\
f(4) = \amp f(3) + 7 = \amp 9 + 7 = 16\\
f(5) = \amp f(4) + 9 = \amp 16 + 9 = 25\\
f(6) = \amp f(5) + 11 = \amp 25 + 11 = 36
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>It looks that this recursively defined function is the same as the explicitly defined function <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = n^2\text{.}\)</span> Is it? Later we will prove that it is.</p>
