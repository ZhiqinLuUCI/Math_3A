<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<p>First, the idea of the argument. What happens when we increase <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> by 1? On the left-hand side, we increase the base of the square and go to the next square number. On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2. This means we double the number. So the question is, how does doubling a number relate to increasing to the next square? Think about what the difference of two consecutive squares looks like. We have <span class="process-math">\((n+1)^2 - n^2\text{.}\)</span> This factors:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n+1-n)(n+1+n) = 2n+1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But doubling the right-hand side increases it by <span class="process-math">\(2^n\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(2^{n+1} = 2^n + 2^n\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is large enough, <span class="process-math">\(2^n &gt; 2n + 1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>What we are saying here is that each time <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> increases, the left-hand side grows by less than the right-hand side. So if the left-hand side starts smaller (as it does when <span class="process-math">\(n = 5\)</span>), it will never catch up. Now the formal proof:</p>
<article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement <span class="process-math">\(n^2 \lt 2^n\text{.}\)</span> We will prove <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all integers <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 5\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Base case: <span class="process-math">\(P(5)\)</span> is the statement <span class="process-math">\(5^2 \lt 2^5\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(5^2 = 25\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2^5 = 32\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(P(5)\)</span> is indeed true.</p>
<p>Inductive case: Let <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 5\)</span> be an arbitrary integer. Assume, for induction, that <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. That is, assume <span class="process-math">\(k^2 \lt  2^k\text{.}\)</span> We will prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true, i.e., <span class="process-math">\((k+1)^2 \lt  2^{k+1}\text{.}\)</span> To prove such an inequality, start with the left-hand side and work towards the right-hand side:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
(k+1)^2 \amp = k^2 + 2k + 1 \amp\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2k + 1 \amp \ldots\text{by the inductive hypothesis.}\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2^k \amp \ldots\text{ since } 2k + 1 \lt  2^k \text{ for }k \ge 5.\\
\amp = 2^{k+1}. \amp
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Following the equalities and inequalities through, we get <span class="process-math">\((k+1)^2 \lt 2^{k+1}\text{,}\)</span> in other words, <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\text{.}\)</span> Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 5\text{.}\)</span></p></article>
