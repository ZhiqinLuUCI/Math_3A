<p>We say that a set of vertices <span class="process-math">\(A \subseteq V\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">vertex cover</dfn> if every edge of the graph is incident to a vertex in the cover (so a vertex cover covers the <em class="emphasis">edges</em>). Since <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> itself is a vertex cover, every graph has a vertex cover. The interesting question is about finding a <dfn class="terminology">minimal</dfn> vertex cover, one that uses the fewest possible number of vertices.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose you had a matching of a graph. How can you use that to get a minimal vertex cover? Will your method always work?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you had a minimal vertex cover for a graph. How can you use that to get a partial matching? Will your method always work?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the relationship between the size of the minimal vertex cover and the size of the maximal partial matching in a graph?</p></li>
