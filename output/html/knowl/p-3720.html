<p>One very useful and common approach to studying graph theory is to restrict your focus to graphs of a particular kind. For example, you could try to really understand just complete graphs or just bipartite graphs, instead of trying to understand all graphs in general. That is what we are going to do now, looking at <em class="emphasis">trees</em>. Hopefully by the end of this section we will have a better understanding of this class of graph, and also understand why it is important enough to warrant its own section.</p>
