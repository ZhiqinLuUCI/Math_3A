<p>It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> We might be able to prove that <span class="process-math">\(n^3 - n\)</span> is even if we knew that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was even. In fact, we could probably prove that <span class="process-math">\(n^3-n\)</span> was even if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was odd. But since <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> must either be even or odd, this will be enough. Here's the proof.</p>
