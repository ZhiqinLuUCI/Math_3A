<p>In this chapter we explored sequences and mathematical induction. At first these might not seem entirely related, but there is a link: recursive reasoning. When we have many cases (maybe infinitely many), it is often easier to describe a particular case by saying how it relates to other cases, instead of describing it absolutely. For sequences, we can describe the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term in the sequence by saying how it is related to the <em class="emphasis">previous</em> term. When showing a statement involving the variable <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is true for all values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we can describe why the case for <span class="process-math">\(n = k\)</span> is true on the basis of why the case for <span class="process-math">\(n = k-1\)</span> is true.</p>
