<p>Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem. What does increasing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> do? Let's try with a few examples. If <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\text{,}\)</span> then yes, <span class="process-math">\(6^1 - 1 = 5\)</span> is a multiple of 5. What does incrementing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to 2 look like? We get <span class="process-math">\(6^2 - 1 = 35\text{,}\)</span> which again is a multiple of 5. Next, <span class="process-math">\(n = 3\text{:}\)</span> but instead of just finding <span class="process-math">\(6^3 - 1\text{,}\)</span> what did the increase in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> do? We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because <span class="process-math">\(6^2 - 1\)</span> is a multiple of 5, so <span class="process-math">\(6^2\)</span> is one more than a multiple of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.</p>
<p>The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5. Now the formal proof:</p>
<article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement, “<span class="process-math">\(6^n - 1\)</span> is a multiple of 5.” We will prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \in \N\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Base case: <span class="process-math">\(P(0)\)</span> is true: <span class="process-math">\(6^0 -1 = 0\)</span> which is a multiple of 5.</p>
<p>Inductive case: Let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be an arbitrary natural number. Assume, for induction, that <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. That is, <span class="process-math">\(6^k - 1\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(6^k - 1 = 5j\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(j\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(6^k = 5j + 1\text{.}\)</span> Multiply both sides by <span class="process-math">\(6\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
6^{k+1} = 6(5j+1) = 30j + 6\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But we want to know about <span class="process-math">\(6^{k+1} - 1\text{,}\)</span> so subtract 1 from both sides:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
6^{k+1} - 1 = 30j + 5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Of course <span class="process-math">\(30j+5 = 5(6j+1)\text{,}\)</span> so is a multiple of 5.</p>
<p>Therefore <span class="process-math">\(6^{k+1} - 1\)</span> is a multiple of 5, or in other words, <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \in \N\text{.}\)</span></p></article>
