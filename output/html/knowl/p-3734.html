<p>To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and get a contradiction.  The two paths might start out the same, but since they are different, there is some first vertex <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> after which the two paths diverge.  However, since the two paths both end and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> there is some first vertex after <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> that they have in common, call it <span class="process-math">\(v'\text{.}\)</span>  Now consider the two paths from <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v'\text{.}\)</span>  Taken together, these form a cycle, which contradicts our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree.</p>
