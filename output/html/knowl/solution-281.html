<p>This is the converse of the statement we proved above using a direct proof. From trying a few examples, this statement definitely appears to be true. So let's prove it.</p>
<p>A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and assuming that <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even. But it is not at all clear how this would allow us to conclude anything about <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Just because <span class="process-math">\(n^2 = 2k\)</span> does not in itself suggest how we could write <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> as a multiple of 2.</p>
<p>Try something else: write the contrapositive of the statement. We get, for all integers <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd then <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is odd. This looks much more promising. Our proof will look something like this:</p>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is not even. This means that …. In other words …. But this is the same as saying …. Therefore <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is not even.</p>
<p>Now we fill in the details:</p>
<article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>We will prove the contrapositive. Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is not even, and thus odd. Then <span class="process-math">\(n= 2k+1\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Now <span class="process-math">\(n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(2k^2 + 2k\)</span> is an integer, we see that <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is odd and therefore not even.</p></article>
