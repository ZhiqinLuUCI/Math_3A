<p>Another caution: how many ways can you select two cards, so that the first one is a red card and the second one is a face card? This looks more like the multiplicative principle (you are counting two separate events) but the answer is not <span class="process-math">\(26 \cdot 12\)</span> here either. The problem is that while there are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the case that <em class="emphasis">for each</em> of those there are 12 ways to select the second card. If the first card was both red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second card.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a></p>
