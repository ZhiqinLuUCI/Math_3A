<p>First, the idea: if we take some number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> maybe it is prime. If so, we are done. If not, then it is composite, so it is the product of two smaller numbers. Each of these factors is smaller than <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (but at least 2), so we can repeat the argument with these numbers. We have reduced to a smaller case.</p>
<p>Now the formal proof:</p>
<article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement, “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is either prime or can be written as the product of primes.” We will prove <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Base case: <span class="process-math">\(P(2)\)</span> is true because <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is indeed prime.</p>
<p>Inductive case: assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(k \lt n\text{.}\)</span> We want to show that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true. That is, we want to show that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is either prime or is the product of primes. If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime, we are done. If not, then <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has more than 2 divisors, so we can write <span class="process-math">\(n = m_1 \cdot m_2\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> less than <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (and greater than 1). By the inductive hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> are each either prime or can be written as the product of primes. In either case, we have that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is written as the product of primes.</p>
<p>Thus by the strong induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 2\text{.}\)</span></p></article>
