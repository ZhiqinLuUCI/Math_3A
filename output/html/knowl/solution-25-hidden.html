<li><p>The claim that <span class="process-math">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true no matter what <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is true is to check or otherwise argue that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove <span class="process-math">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is false. This is often called a counterexample.</p></li>
<li><p>We are simply claiming that there is some element <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in the domain of discourse for which <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim.</p></li>
<li><p>Here we are claiming that no element we find will make <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> true. The only way to be sure of this is to verify that <em class="emphasis">every</em> element of the domain makes <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> false. Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is true.</p></li>
