<p>It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> We might be able to prove that <span class="process-math">\(n^3 - n\)</span> is even if we knew that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was even. In fact, we could probably prove that <span class="process-math">\(n^3-n\)</span> was even if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was odd. But since <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> must either be even or odd, this will be enough. Here's the proof.</p>
<article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>We consider two cases: if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even or if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd.</p>
<p>Case 1: <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even. Then <span class="process-math">\(n = 2k\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This give</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = 8k^3 - 2k\\
\amp = 2(4k^2 - k)\text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and since <span class="process-math">\(4k^2 - k\)</span> is an integer, this says that <span class="process-math">\(n^3-n\)</span> is even.</p>
<p>Case 2: <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd. Then <span class="process-math">\(n = 2k+1\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)\\
\amp = 8k^3 + 6k^2 + 6k + 1 - 2k - 1\\
\amp = 2(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k)\text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and since <span class="process-math">\(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k\)</span> is an integer, we see that <span class="process-math">\(n^3 - n\)</span> is even again.</p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(n^3 - n\)</span> is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that <span class="process-math">\(n^3 - n\)</span> is indeed always even.</p></article>
