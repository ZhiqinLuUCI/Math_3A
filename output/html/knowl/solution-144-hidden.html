<p>We saw in <a href="sec_counting-binom.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Binomial Coefficients">SectionÂ 1.2</a> that the answer to both these questions is <span class="process-math">\(2^9\text{,}\)</span> as we can say yes or no (or 0 or 1) to each of the 9 elements in the set (positions in the bit-string). But <span class="process-math">\(2^9\)</span> also looks like the answer you get from counting functions. In fact, if you count all functions <span class="process-math">\(f: A \to B\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(|A| = 9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|B| = 2\text{,}\)</span> this is exactly what you get.</p>
<p>This makes sense! Let <span class="process-math">\(A = \{1,2,\ldots, 9\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B = \{y, n\}\text{.}\)</span> We are assigning each element of the set either a yes or a no. Or in the language of bit-strings, we would take the 9 positions in the bit string as our domain and the set <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> as the codomain.</p>
