<p>Not a huge surprise: one way to count the number of squares in a <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 4\)</span> chessboard is to notice that there are <span class="process-math">\(16\)</span> squares with side length 1, 9 with side length 2, 4 with side length 3 and 1 with side length 4. So the original sequence is just the sum of squares. Now this sequence of differences is not arithmetic since it's sequence of differences (the differences of the differences of the original sequence) is not constant. In fact, this sequence of <dfn class="terminology">second differences</dfn> is </p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
5, 7, 9, \ldots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which <em class="emphasis">is</em> an arithmetic sequence (with constant difference 2). Notice that our original sequence had <dfn class="terminology">third differences</dfn> (that is, differences of differences of differences of the original) constant. We will call such a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^3\)</span>-constant. The sequence <span class="process-math">\(1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots\)</span> has second differences constant, so it will be a <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant sequence. In general, we will say a sequence is a <dfn class="terminology"><span class="process-math">\(\Delta^k\)</span>-constant</dfn>  sequence if the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th differences are constant.</p>
