<li><p>This is the sequence from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-sum-of-arithmetic.html" title="Example 2.2.6">ExampleÂ 2.2.6</a>, in which we found a closed formula by recognizing the sequence as the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic sequence. Indeed, the sequence of first differences is <span class="process-math">\(1,4,7, 10, 13,\ldots\text{,}\)</span> which itself has differences <span class="process-math">\(3,3,3,3,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37,\ldots\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>These are the perfect cubes. The sequence of first differences is <span class="process-math">\(7, 19, 37, 61, 91, \ldots\text{;}\)</span> the sequence of second differences is <span class="process-math">\(12, 18, 24, 30,\ldots\text{;}\)</span> the sequence of third differences is constant: <span class="process-math">\(6,6,6,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Thus the perfect cubes are a <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^3\)</span>-constant sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>If we take first differences we get <span class="process-math">\(1,2,4,8,16,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Wait, what? That's the sequence we started with. So taking second differences will give us the same sequence again. No matter how many times we repeat this we will always have the same sequence, which in particular means no finite number of differences will be constant. Thus this sequence is not <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^k\)</span>-constant for any <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
