<p>Suppose we want to solve a recurrence relation expressed as a combination of the two previous terms, such as <span class="process-math">\(a_n = a_{n-1} + 6a_{n-2}\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we want to find a function of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> which satisfies <span class="process-math">\(a_n - a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2} = 0\text{.}\)</span> Now iteration is too complicated, but think just for a second what would happen if we <em class="emphasis">did</em> iterate. In each step, we would, among other things, multiply a previous iteration by 6. So our closed formula would include <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> multiplied some number of times. Thus it is reasonable to guess the solution will contain parts that look geometric. Perhaps the solution will take the form <span class="process-math">\(r^n\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span></p>
