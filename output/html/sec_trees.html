</ol></article><p id="kCL">One very useful and common approach to studying graph theory is to restrict your focus to graphs of a particular kind. For example, you could try to really understand just complete graphs or just bipartite graphs, instead of trying to understand all graphs in general. That is what we are going to do now, looking at <em class="emphasis">trees</em>. Hopefully by the end of this section we will have a better understanding of this class of graph, and also understand why it is important enough to warrant its own section.</p>
<article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="kYk"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Definition of a Tree.</span></h3>
<p id="QJU">A <dfn class="terminology">tree</dfn> is a connected graph containing no cycles.<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-17" id="fn-17"><sup> 4 </sup></a></p>
<p id="wRd">A <dfn class="terminology">forest</dfn> is a graph containing no cycles.   Note that this means that a connected forest is a tree.</p></article><p id="cYm">Does the definition above agree with your intuition for what graphs we should call trees? Try thinking of examples of trees and make sure they satisfy the definition. One thing to keep in mind is that while the trees we study in graph theory are related to trees you might see in other subjects, the correspondence is not exact. For instance, in anthropology, you might study family trees, like the one below,</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/family-tree.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></div></div>
<p id="Jfv">So far so good, but while your grandparents are (probably) not blood-relatives, if we go back far enough, it is likely that they did have <em class="emphasis">some</em> common ancestor. If you trace the tree back from you to that common ancestor, then down through your other grandparent, you would have a cycle, and thus the graph would not be a tree.</p>
<p id="pmE">You might also have seen something called a <em class="emphasis">decision tree</em> (such as the algorithm for deciding whether a series converges or diverges). Sometimes these too contain cycles, as the decision for one node might lead you back to a previous step.</p>
<p id="VtN"> Both the examples of trees above also have another feature worth mentioning: there is a clear order to the vertices in the tree. In general, there is no reason for a tree to have this added structure, although we can impose such a structure by considering <dfn class="terminology">rooted trees</dfn>, where we simply designate one vertex as the <em class="emphasis">root</em>. We will consider such trees in more detail later in this section.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="MvA"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="NPo">We wish to really understand trees. This means we should discover properties of trees; what makes them special and what is special about them.</p>
<p id="tWx">A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Is there anything else we can say? It would be nice to have other equivalent conditions for a graph to be a tree. That is, we would like to know whether there are any graph theoretic properties that all trees have, and perhaps even that <em class="emphasis">only</em> trees have.</p>
<p id="adG">To get a feel for the sorts of things we can say, we will consider three <em class="emphasis">propositions</em> about trees.  These will also illustrate important proof techniques that apply to graphs in general, and happen to be a little easier for trees.</p>
<p id="GkP">Our first proposition gives an alternate definition for a tree.  That is, it gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be a tree.</p>

<span class="type">Proposition</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.2.1</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h4>
<p id="vbQ">A graph <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree if and only if between every pair of distinct vertices of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> there is a unique path.</p></article><article class="proof" id="zbP"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h4>
<p id="Nfu">This is an “if and only if” statement, so we must prove two implications.  We start by proving that if <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, then between every pair of distinct vertices there is a unique path.</p>
<p id="tmD">Assume <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, and let <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> be distinct vertices (if <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> only has one vertex, then the conclusion is satisfied automatically).  We must show two things to show that there is a unique path between <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{:}\)</span> that there is a path, and that there is not more than one path.  The first of these is automatic, since <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, it is connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.</p>
<p id="ZtM">To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and get a contradiction.  The two paths might start out the same, but since they are different, there is some first vertex <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> after which the two paths diverge.  However, since the two paths both end and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> there is some first vertex after <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> that they have in common, call it <span class="process-math">\(v'\text{.}\)</span>  Now consider the two paths from <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v'\text{.}\)</span>  Taken together, these form a cycle, which contradicts our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree.</p>
<p id="FAV">Now we consider the converse: if between every pair of distinct vertices of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> there is a unique path, then <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree.  So assume the hypothesis: between every pair of distinct vertices of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> there is a unique path.  To prove that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, we must show it is connected and contains no cycles.</p>
<p id="lIe">The first half of this is easy: <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is connected, because there is a path between every pair of vertices.  To show that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no cycles, we assume it does, for the sake of contradiction.  Let <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> be two distinct vertices in a cycle of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>  Since we can get from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> by going clockwise or counterclockwise around the cycle, there are two paths from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> contradicting our assumption.</p>
<p id="RPn">We have established both directions so we have completed the proof.</p></article><p id="mrY">Read the proof above very carefully.  Notice that both directions had two parts: the existence of paths, and the uniqueness of paths (which related to the fact that there were no cycles).  In this case, these two parts were really separate.  In fact, if we just considered graphs with no cycles (a forest), then we could still do the parts of the proof that explore the uniqueness of paths between vertices, even if there might not <em class="emphasis">exist</em> paths between vertices.</p>
<p id="Szh">This observation allows us to state the following <em class="emphasis">corollary</em>:<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-18" id="fn-18"><sup> 5 </sup></a></p>

When you do so, try to use proof by contrapositive instead of proof by contradiction.</p>

<p id="qrX">This contradiction proves that there must be at least two vertices of degree one.

<p id="CGp">For the base case, consider all trees with <span class="process-math">\(v = 1\)</span> vertices.  There is only one such tree: the graph with a single isolated vertex.

<p id="jxs">So far, we have thought of trees only as a particular kind of graph. However, it is often useful to add additional structure to trees to help solve problems. Data is often structured like a tree. This book, for example, has a tree structure: draw a vertex for the book itself. Then draw vertices for each chapter, connected to the book vertex. Under each chapter, draw a vertex for each section, connecting it to the chapter it belongs to. The graph will not have any cycles; it will be a tree. But a tree with clear hierarchy which is not present if we don't identify the book vertex as the “top”.</p>
<p id="PEB"> As soon as one vertex of a tree is designated as the <dfn class="terminology">root</dfn>, then every other vertex on the tree can be characterized by its position relative to the root.  This works because there is a unique path between any two vertices in a tree.  So from any vertex, we can travel back to the root in exactly one way.  This also allows us to describe how distinct vertices in a rooted tree are related.</p>
<p id="vLK"> If two vertices are adjacent, then we say one of them is the <dfn class="terminology">parent</dfn> of the other, which is called the <dfn class="terminology">child</dfn> of the parent.  Of the two, the parent is the vertex that is closer to the root.  Thus the root of a tree is a parent, but is not the child of any vertex (and is unique in this respect: all non-root vertices have <em class="emphasis">exactly one</em> parent).</p>
<p id="bST"> Not surprisingly, the child of a child of a vertex is called the <dfn class="terminology">grandchild</dfn> of the vertex (and it is the <dfn class="terminology">grandparent</dfn>).  More in general, we say that a vertex <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">descendent</dfn> of a vertex <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> provided <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is a vertex on the path from <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> to the root.  Then we would call <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> an <dfn class="terminology">ancestor</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="Iac"> For most trees (in fact, all except paths with one end the root), there will be pairs of vertices neither of which is a descendant of the other.  We might call these cousins or siblings.  In fact, vertices <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> are called <dfn class="terminology">siblings</dfn> provided they have the same parent.  Note that siblings are never adjacent (do you see why?).</p>

<p id="ARc">Designate any vertex as the root.

</div></div>
</div></article><p id="Uou"> The key to how we partitioned the tree in the example was to know which vertex to assign to a set next.

<p id="AvD"> In contrast, we could also have partitioned the tree in a different order.  Start with the root, put it in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  Then look for one child of the root to put in <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  Then find a child of that vertex, into <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and then find its child, into <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and so on.

<p id="MJV">One of the advantages of trees is that they give us a few simple ways to travel through the vertices.  If a connected graph is not a tree, then we can still use these traversal algorithms if we identify a subgraph that <em class="emphasis">is</em> a tree.</p>
<p id="sRe">First we should consider if this even makes sense.  Given any connected graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> will there always be a subgraph that is a tree?  Well, that is actually too easy: you could just take a single vertex of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>  If we want to use this subgraph to tell us how to visit all vertices, then we want our subgraph to include all of the vertices.  We call such a tree a <dfn class="terminology">spanning tree</dfn>.  It turns out that every connected graph has one (and usually many).</p>

Start with a connected graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>  If there is no cycle, then <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is already a tree and we are done.  If there is a cycle, let <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> be any edge in that cycle and consider the new graph <span class="process-math">\(G_1 = G - e\)</span> (i.e., the graph you get by deleting <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span>).  This tree is still connected since <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> belonged to a cycle, there were at least two paths between its incident vertices.
