<p>These statements are NOT logically equivalent. To see this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate <span class="process-math">\(P(x,y)\)</span> which makes one of the statements true and the other false.</p>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P(x,y)\)</span> be the predicate <span class="process-math">\(x \lt y\text{.}\)</span> It is true, in the natural numbers, that for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> there is some <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> greater than that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> (since there are infinitely many numbers). However, there is not a natural number <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> which is greater than every number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Thus it is possible for <span class="process-math">\(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\)</span> to be true while <span class="process-math">\(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\)</span> is false.</p>
<p>We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> for which every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> satisfies <span class="process-math">\(P(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> then certainly for every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> there is some <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> which satisfies <span class="process-math">\(P(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> The first is saying we can find one <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> that works for every <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> The second allows different <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>'s to work for different <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>'s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> that work for every <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> In other words, while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction rule:</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;"><div class="sbspanel fixed-width top" style="width:100%;"><table class="tabular" id="Zuz">
<tr>
<td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0 lines"></td>
<td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0 lines"><span class="process-math">\(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0 lines"><span class="process-math">\(\therefore\)</span></td>
<td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0 lines"><span class="process-math">\(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\)</span></td>
</tr>
</table></div></div></div>
<p>Put yet another way, this says that the single statement</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\exists y \forall x P(x,y) \imp \forall x \exists y P(x,y)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">is always true. This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve that term for necessary truths in propositional logic. A statement in predicate logic that is necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a <dfn class="terminology">law of logic</dfn>  (or sometimes <dfn class="terminology">logically valid</dfn>,  but that is less fun).</p>
