<p>Note the similarities and differences in these proofs. Both are proofs by contradiction, and both start with using Euler's formula to derive the (supposed) number of faces in the graph. Then we find a relationship between the number of faces and the number of edges based on how many edges surround each face. This is the only difference. In the proof for <span class="process-math">\(K_5\text{,}\)</span> we got <span class="process-math">\(3f \le 2e\)</span> and for <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> we go <span class="process-math">\(4f \le 2e\text{.}\)</span> The coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is the key. It is the smallest number of edges which could surround any face. If some number of edges surround a face, then these edges form a cycle. So that number is the size of the smallest cycle in the graph.</p>
