<p>For a given predicate <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\text{,}\)</span> you might believe that the statements <span class="process-math">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> are either true or false. How would you decide if you were correct in each case?  You have four choices: you could give an example of an element <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in the domain for which <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true or for which <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> if false, or you could argue that no matter what <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true or is false.</p>
