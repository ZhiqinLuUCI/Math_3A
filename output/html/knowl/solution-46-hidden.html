<li><p><span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range. For example, no <span class="process-math">\(n \in \Z\)</span> gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> would be sent to 1, but <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function is <span class="process-math">\(3\Z\)</span> (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is not surjective. There is no <span class="process-math">\(x \in \{1,2,3\}\)</span> (the domain) for which <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = b\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> which is in the codomain, is not in the range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain “missing” from the bottom row of the matrix.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is surjective. Every element of the codomain is also in the range. Nothing in the codomain is missed.</p></li>
