<p>This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is exactly <span class="process-math">\(2162160 = P(14,6)\)</span>). It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests. To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as just one outcome). There are precisely <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> ways to arrange 6 guests, so the correct answer to the first question is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11\cdot 10 \cdot 9}{6!}\text{.}
