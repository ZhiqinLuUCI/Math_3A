</ol></article><p id="yzM">Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs. Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging. There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that “Goldbach's Conjecture” holds for all numbers less than <span class="process-math">\(4\times 10^{18}\text{,}\)</span> which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).</p>
<p id="eGV">Writing proofs is a bit of an art. Like any art, to be truly great at it, you need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique. Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct arguments. A good place to start might be to study a classic.</p>

Therefore there are infinitely many primes.</p></article><p id="KOe">This proof is an example of a <em class="emphasis">proof by contradiction</em>, one of the standard styles of mathematical proof. First and foremost, the proof is an argument. It contains sequence of statements, the last being the <em class="emphasis">conclusion</em> which follows from the previous statements. The argument is valid so the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. Let's go through the proof line by line.</p>
<ol id="qVn" class="decimal">
<li id="AaE"><p id="asB">Suppose there are only finitely many primes. <em class="emphasis">[this is a premise. Note the use of “suppose.”]</em></p></li>
<li id="ghN"><p id="GzK">There must be a largest prime, call it <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">[follows from line 1, by the definition of “finitely many.”]</em></p></li>
<li id="MoW"><p id="mGT">Let <span class="process-math">\(N = p! + 1\text{.}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">[basically just notation, although this is the inspired part of the proof; looking at <span class="process-math">\(p! + 1\)</span> is the key insight.]</em></p></li>

<li id="EKx"><p id="SOc">The prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> contains prime numbers greater than <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">[since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is divisible by each prime number in the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> and by line 5.]</em></p></li>
<li id="kRG"><p id="yVl">Therefore <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is not the largest prime. <em class="emphasis">[by line 6, <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is divisible by a prime larger than <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span>]</em></p></li>
<li id="QYP"><p id="fcu">This is a contradiction. <em class="emphasis">[from line 2 and line 7: the largest prime is <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and there is a prime larger than <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span>]</em></p></li>
<li id="xfY"><p id="LjD">Therefore there are infinitely many primes. <em class="emphasis">[from line 1 and line 8: our only premise lead to a contradiction, so the premise is false.]</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p id="Xcw">We should say a bit more about the last line. Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise “there are only finitely many primes” and the conclusion “there is a prime larger than the largest prime.” This is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines. So if the premises are true, then the conclusion <em class="emphasis">must</em> be true. However, the conclusion is NOT true. The only way out: the premise must be false.</p>
<p id="DjF">The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on. Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook, you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true. Additionally, it is equally important to understand the overall structure of the proof. This is where using tools from logic is helpful. Luckily there are a relatively small number of standard proof styles that keep showing up again and again. Being familiar with these can help understand proof, as well as give ideas of how to write your own.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="Ruo"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="jqO">The simplest (from a logic perspective) style of proof is a <dfn class="terminology">direct proof</dfn>. Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means. Direct proofs are especially useful when proving implications. The general format to prove <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="CVk"><p id="kwh">Assume <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> Explain, explain, …, explain. Therefore <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p></blockquote>
<p id="PxX">Often we want to prove universal statements, perhaps of the form <span class="process-math">\(\forall x (P(x) \imp Q(x))\text{.}\)</span> Again, we will want to assume <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> is true and deduce <span class="process-math">\(Q(x)\text{.}\)</span> But what about the <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span> We want this to work for <em class="emphasis">all</em> <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> We accomplish this by fixing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to be an arbitrary element (of the sort we are interested in).</p>

<p id="gwi">This is why <dfn class="terminology">proof by contradiction</dfn> works.

<p id="lgb">So far we have gotten only primes. You might be tempted to conjecture, “For all positive integers <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> the number <span class="process-math">\(n^2 - n + 41\)</span> is prime.” If you wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples. In fact, we can prove this conjecture is <em class="emphasis">false</em> by proving its negation: “There is a positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(n^2 - n + 41\)</span> is not prime.” Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.</p>
<p id="Rnk">In fact, we can quickly see that <span class="process-math">\(n = 41\)</span> will give <span class="process-math">\(41^2\)</span> which is certainly not prime. You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture that <span class="process-math">\(n^2 - n + 41\)</span> is always prime. Since so many statements in mathematics are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that a statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample.</p>

<p id="iGU">The converse is the statement, “for all integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is odd or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is odd, then <span class="process-math">\(a + b\)</span> is odd.” This is false! How do we prove it is false? We need to prove the negation of the converse. Let's look at the symbols. The converse is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="OOd">We want to prove the negation:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\neg \forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="uVm">Simplify using the rules from the previous sections:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\exists a \exists b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \wedge \neg O(a+b))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="bcv">As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from <span class="process-math">\(\forall\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\exists\text{.}\)</span> We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.</p>
<p id="HjE">Now we know what to do. To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is odd or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is odd, but <span class="process-math">\(a+b\)</span> is not odd (so even). That's easy: 1 and 3. (remember, “or” means one or the other or both). Both of these are odd, but <span class="process-math">\(1+3 = 4\)</span> is not odd.</p>

<p id="xut">We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we haven't even mentioned induction or combinatorial proofs here), but instead we will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases. The idea is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true by proving that <span class="process-math">\(Q \imp P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\neg Q \imp P\)</span> for some statement <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> So no matter what, whether or not <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true, we know that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true. In fact, we could generalize this. Suppose we want to prove <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> We know that at least one of the statements <span class="process-math">\(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n\)</span> is true. If we can show that <span class="process-math">\(Q_1 \imp P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_2 \imp P\)</span> and so on all the way to <span class="process-math">\(Q_n \imp P\text{,}\)</span> then we can conclude <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases (the <span class="process-math">\(Q_i\)</span>'s) must be true no matter what.</p>
