<p><span class="process-math">\((6, 10, 18, 34, 66, \ldots )\text{.}\)</span> To get from one term to the next, we almost double each term. So maybe we can relate this back to <span class="process-math">\(2^n\text{.}\)</span> Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2. So we get <span class="process-math">\(h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2\)</span> (the <span class="process-math">\(n+2\)</span> is because the first term is 2 more than <span class="process-math">\(2^2\text{,}\)</span> not <span class="process-math">\(2^0\)</span>). Alternatively, we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, â€¦ we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence. That sequence had closed formula <span class="process-math">\(c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1\text{.}\)</span> Our sequence here would be twice this, so <span class="process-math">\(h_n = 2(2^n + 1)\text{,}\)</span> which is the same as we got before.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_seq_intro.html#mVB" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
