<p> Discrete math deals with whole numbers of things. So when we want to solve equations, we usually are looking for <em class="emphasis">integer</em> solutions. Equations which are intended to only have integer solutions were first studied by in the third century by the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria, and as such are called <em class="emphasis">Diophantine equations</em>. Probably the most famous example of a Diophantine equation is <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span> The integer solutions to this equation are called <dfn class="terminology">Pythagorean triples</dfn>. In general, solving Diophantine equations is hard (in fact, there is provably no general algorithm for deciding whether a Diophantine equation has a solution, a result known as Matiyasevich's Theorem). We will restrict our focus to <em class="emphasis">linear</em> Diophantine equations, which are considerably easier to work with.</p>
