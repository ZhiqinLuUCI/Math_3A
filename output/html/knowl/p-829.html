<p>When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> which <em class="emphasis">is</em> the image of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>). Sometimes we will want to talk about all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain. It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain it is the image of. We could write “those <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain such that <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = y\text{,}\)</span>” but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.</p>
