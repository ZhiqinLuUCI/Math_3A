<p>By now you should agree that the answer to the first question is <span class="process-math">\(9 \cdot 5 = 45\)</span> and the answer to the second question is <span class="process-math">\(9 + 5 = 14\text{.}\)</span> These are the multiplicative and additive principles. There are two events: picking a shirt and picking a pair of pants. The first event can happen in 9 ways and the second event can happen in 5 ways. To get both a shirt and a pair of pants, you multiply. To get just one article of clothing, you add.</p>
<p>Now look at this using sets. There are two sets, call them <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> contains all 9 shirts so <span class="process-math">\(|S| = 9\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(|P| = 5\text{,}\)</span> since there are 5 elements in the set <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> (namely your 5 pairs of pants). What are we asking in terms of these sets? Well in question 2, we really want <span class="process-math">\(|S \cup P|\text{,}\)</span> the number of elements in the union of shirts and pants. This is just <span class="process-math">\(|S| + |P|\)</span> (since there is no overlap; <span class="process-math">\(|S \cap P| = 0\)</span>). Question 1 is slightly more complicated. Your first guess might be to find <span class="process-math">\(|S \cap P|\text{,}\)</span> but this is not right (there is nothing in the intersection). We are not asking for how many clothing items are both a shirt and a pair of pants. Instead, we want one of each. We could think of this as asking how many pairs <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> there are, where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a shirt and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a pair of pants. As we will soon verify, this number is <span class="process-math">\(|S| \cdot |P|\text{.}\)</span></p>
