<p>If that looks daunting, go back to the case of <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^3 = (x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\text{.}\)</span> Why do we only have one <span class="process-math">\(x^3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y^3\)</span> but three <span class="process-math">\(x^2y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(xy^2\)</span> terms? Every time we distribute over an <span class="process-math">\((x+y)\)</span> we create two copies of what is left, one multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> the other multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> To get <span class="process-math">\(x^3\text{,}\)</span> we need to pick the “multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>” side every time (we don't have any <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>'s in the term). This will only happen once. On the other hand, to get <span class="process-math">\(x^2y\)</span> we need to select the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> side twice and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> side once. In other words, we need to pick one of the three <span class="process-math">\((x+y)\)</span> terms to “contribute” their <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span></p>
