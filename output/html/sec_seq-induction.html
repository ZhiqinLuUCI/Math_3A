<section class="introduction" id="duL"><p id="rcR"> Mathematical induction is a proof technique, not unlike direct proof or proof by contradiction or combinatorial proof.<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-10" id="fn-10"><sup> 3 </sup></a> In other words, induction is a style of argument we use to convince ourselves and others that a mathematical statement is always true. Many mathematical statements can be proved by simply explaining what they mean. Others are very difficult to prove—in fact, there are relatively simple mathematical statements which nobody yet knows how to prove. To facilitate the discovery of proofs, it is important to be familiar with some standard styles of arguments. Induction is one such style. Let's start with an example:</p></section><section class="subsection" id="vyp"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber"></span> <span class="title">Stamps</span>
</h3>
<article class="project-like" id="MwA"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="type">Investigate!</span> </h6>
<p id="Xka">You need to mail a package, but don't yet know how much postage you will need. You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps. Which amounts of postage can you make exactly using these stamps? Which amounts are impossible to make?</p></article><p id="Upu">Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some amounts of postage, and then figured out whether you could make that amount using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps. Perhaps you did this in order: can you make 1 cent of postage? Can you make 2 cents? 3 cents? And so on. If this is what you did, you were actually answering a <em class="emphasis">sequence</em> of questions. We have methods for dealing with sequences. Let's see if that helps.</p>
<p id="AwD">Actually, we will not make a sequence of questions, but rather a sequence of statements. Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span>  be the statement “you can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps.” Since for each value of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is a statement, it is either true or false. So if we form the sequence of statements</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), \ldots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">the sequence will consist of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span>'s (for true) and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>'s (for false). In our particular case the sequence starts</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
F,F,F,F,T,F,F,T,F,T,F,F,T,\ldots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">because <span class="process-math">\(P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4)\)</span> are all false (you cannot make 1, 2, 3, or 4 cents of postage) but <span class="process-math">\(P(5)\)</span> is true (use one 5-cent stamp), and so on.</p>
<p id="gDM">Let's think a bit about how we could find the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> for some specific <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (the “value” will be either <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>). How did we find the value of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term of a sequence of numbers? How did we find <span class="process-math">\(a_n\text{?}\)</span> There were two ways we could do this: either there was a closed formula for <span class="process-math">\(a_n\text{,}\)</span> so we could plug in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> into the formula and get our output value, or we had a recursive definition for the sequence, so we could use the previous terms of the sequence to compute the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term. When dealing with sequences of statements, we could use either of these techniques as well. Maybe there is a way to use <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> itself to determine whether we can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage. That would be something like a closed formula. Or instead we could use the previous terms in the sequence (of statements) to determine whether we can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage. That is, if we know the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n-1)\text{,}\)</span> can we get from that to the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\text{?}\)</span> That would be something like a recursive definition for the sequence. Remember, finding recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed formulas. The same is true here.</p>
<p id="MKV">Suppose I told you that <span class="process-math">\(P(43)\)</span> was true (it is). Can you determine from this fact the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> (whether it true or false)? Yes you can. Even if we don't know how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent stamps, we do know that there was some way to do it. What if that way used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)? We could replace those three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps (making 16 cents). The total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way to make 44 cents, so <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> is true. Of course, we assumed that we had at least three 5-cent stamps. What if we didn't? Then we must have at least three 8-cent stamps (making 24 cents). If we replace those three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have bumped up our total by 1 cent so we can make 44 cents, so <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> is true.</p>
<p id="sSe">Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents, just that we can, on the basis that we can make 43 cents. How do we know we can make 43 cents? Perhaps because we know we can make <span class="process-math">\(42\)</span>  cents, which we know we can do because we know we can make 41 cents, and so on. It's a recursion! As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence, we must specify our initial value. In this case, the initial value is “<span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is false.” That's not good, since our recurrence relation just says that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true <em class="emphasis">if</em> <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is also true. We need to start the process with a true <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\text{.}\)</span> So instead, we might want to use “<span class="process-math">\(P(28)\)</span> is true” as the initial condition.</p>
<p id="YZn">Putting this all together we arrive at the following fact: it is possible to (exactly) make any amount of postage greater than 27 cents using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-11" id="fn-11"><sup> 4 </sup></a> In other words, <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for any <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\text{.}\)</span> To prove this, we could do the following:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="ryq"><p id="cps">Demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(P(28)\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li id="XFz"><p id="IwB">Prove that if <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true, then <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true (for any <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\)</span>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="Fgw">Suppose we have done this. Then we know that the 28th term of the sequence above is a <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> (using step 1, the initial condition or <dfn class="terminology">base case</dfn>),  and that every term after the 28th is <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> also (using step 2, the recursive part or <dfn class="terminology">inductive case</dfn>).  Here is what the proof would actually look like.</p>
<article class="proof" id="GHo"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h4>
<p id="cZm">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement “it is possible to make exactly <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.” We will show <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 28\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="Jgv">First, we show that <span class="process-math">\(P(28)\)</span> is true: <span class="process-math">\(28 = 4 \cdot 5+ 1\cdot 8\text{,}\)</span> so we can make <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span> cents using four 5-cent stamps and one 8-cent stamp.</p>
<p id="pnE">Now suppose <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for some arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\text{.}\)</span> Then it is possible to make <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. Note that since <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\text{,}\)</span> it cannot be that we use fewer than three 5-cent stamps <em class="emphasis">and</em> fewer than three 8-cent stamps: using two of each would give only 26 cents. Now if we have made <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents using at least three 5-cent stamps, replace three 5-cent stamps by two 8-cent stamps. This replaces 15 cents of postage with 16 cents, moving from a total of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents to <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> cents. Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true. On the other hand, if we have made <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents using at least three 8-cent stamps, then we can replace three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps, moving from 24 cents to 25 cents, giving a total of <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> cents of postage.

<p id="lnF">What we did in the stamp example above works for many types of problems. Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about all natural numbers, or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first case (like 28 in the example above), and in some other situations too. In particular, induction should be used when there is some way to go from one case to the next – when you can see how to always “do one more.”</p>
<p id="RuO">This is a big idea. Thinking about a problem <em class="emphasis">inductively</em> can give new insight into the problem. For example, to really understand the stamp problem, you should think about how any amount of postage (greater than 28 cents) can be made (this is non-inductive reasoning) and also how the ways in which postage can be made <em class="emphasis">changes</em> as the amount increases (inductive reasoning). When you are asked to provide a proof by induction, you are being asked to think about the problem <em class="emphasis">dynamically</em>; how does increasing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> change the problem?</p>
<p id="xBX">But there is another side to proofs by induction as well. In mathematics, it is not enough to understand a problem, you must also be able to communicate the problem to others. Like any discipline, mathematics has standard language and style, allowing mathematicians to share their ideas efficiently. Proofs by induction have a certain formal style, and being able to write in this style is important. It allows us to keep our ideas organized and might even help us with formulating a proof.</p>
<p id="dJg">Here is the general structure of a proof by mathematical induction:</p>
<article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="UaZ"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Induction Proof Structure.</span></h4>
<p id="bTT"> Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: “Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement…” To prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 0\text{,}\)</span> you must prove two facts:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="DMI"><p id="oDK"> Base case: Prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(0)\)</span> is true. You do this directly. This is often easy.</p></li>
<li id="jTR"><p id="UKT"> Inductive case: Prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(k) \imp P(k+1)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 0\text{.}\)</span> That is, prove that for any <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 0\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true, then <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true as well. This is the proof of an if … then … statement, so you can assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true (<span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is called the <em class="emphasis">inductive hypothesis</em>).  You must then explain why <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is also true, given that assumption.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="Ibc">Assuming you are successful on both parts above, you can conclude, “Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 0\text{.}\)</span>”</p></article><p id="JQp">Sometimes the statement <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> will only be true for values of <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 4\text{,}\)</span> for example, or some other value. In such cases, replace all the 0's above with 4's (or the other value).</p>
<p id="pXy">The other advantage of formalizing inductive proofs is it allows us to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid. Why does induction work? Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges. We want to argue that in a minute, all the dominoes will have fallen down. For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino. That is the base case. It will also have to be that the dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls, it will cause the next domino to fall. That is the inductive case. If both of these conditions are met, you push the first domino over and each domino will cause the next to fall, then all the dominoes will fall.</p>
<p id="WeH">Induction is powerful! Think how much easier it is to knock over dominoes when you don't have to push over each domino yourself. You just start the chain reaction, and the rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the rest.</p>
<p id="ClQ">Think about our study of sequences. It is easier to find recursive definitions for sequences than closed formulas. Going from one case to the next is easier than going directly to a particular case. That is what is so great about induction. Instead of going directly to the (arbitrary) case for <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we just need to say how to get from one case to the next.</p>
<p id="isZ">When you are asked to prove a statement by mathematical induction, you should first think about <em class="emphasis">why</em> the statement is true, using inductive reasoning. Explain why induction is the right thing to do, and roughly why the inductive case will work. Then, sit down and write out a careful, formal proof using the structure above.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="HMH"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="Ngu">First, let's think inductively about this equation. In fact, we know this is true for other reasons (reverse and add comes to mind). But why might induction be applicable? The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If we know how to do that, adding just one more term (<span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span>) would not be that hard. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(n = 100\text{,}\)</span> suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is <span class="process-math">\(5050\)</span> (so <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 = 5050\text{,}\)</span> which is true). Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We would have <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 = 5151\text{.}\)</span> In fact, it would always be easy to add just one more term. This is why we should use induction.</p>
<p id="tnD">Now the formal proof:</p>
<article class="proof" id="pJd"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p id="ZuM">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\text{.}\)</span> We will show that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="FBV">Base case: <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is the statement <span class="process-math">\(1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}\)</span> which is clearly true.</p>
<p id="lJe">Inductive case: Let <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 1\)</span> be a natural number. Assume (for induction) that <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. That means <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}\text{.}\)</span> We will prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true as well. That is, we must prove that <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\text{.}\)</span> To prove this equation, start by adding <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> to both sides of the inductive hypothesis:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)\text{.}

<p id="RQn">Now, simplifying the right side we get:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="" id="lXz">
\begin{align*}
\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k+1 \amp = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{(k+2)(k+1)}{2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p id="xXw">Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</span></p></article>

</div></article><p id="uHr">Note that in the part of the proof in which we proved <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\text{,}\)</span> we used the equation <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\text{.}\)</span> This was the inductive hypothesis.

<p id="eeF">Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem. What does increasing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> do? Let's try with a few examples. If <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\text{,}\)</span> then yes, <span class="process-math">\(6^1 - 1 = 5\)</span> is a multiple of 5. What does incrementing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to 2 look like? We get <span class="process-math">\(6^2 - 1 = 35\text{,}\)</span> which again is a multiple of 5. Next, <span class="process-math">\(n = 3\text{:}\)</span> but instead of just finding <span class="process-math">\(6^3 - 1\text{,}\)</span> what did the increase in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> do? We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because <span class="process-math">\(6^2 - 1\)</span> is a multiple of 5, so <span class="process-math">\(6^2\)</span> is one more than a multiple of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.</p>
<p id="KlO">The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5. Now the formal proof:</p>

<p id="qsX">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement, “<span class="process-math">\(6^n - 1\)</span> is a multiple of 5.” We will prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \in \N\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="WAg">Base case: <span class="process-math">\(P(0)\)</span> is true: <span class="process-math">\(6^0 -1 = 0\)</span> which is a multiple of 5.</p>

<p id="bjZ">First, the idea of the argument. What happens when we increase <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> by 1? On the left-hand side, we increase the base of the square and go to the next square number. On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2. This means we double the number. So the question is, how does doubling a number relate to increasing to the next square? Think about what the difference of two consecutive squares looks like. We have <span class="process-math">\((n+1)^2 - n^2\text{.}\)</span> This factors:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n+1-n)(n+1+n) = 2n+1\text{.}

<p id="Hri">But doubling the right-hand side increases it by <span class="process-math">\(2^n\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(2^{n+1} = 2^n + 2^n\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is large enough, <span class="process-math">\(2^n &gt; 2n + 1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="nyr">What we are saying here is that each time <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> increases, the left-hand side grows by less than the right-hand side. So if the left-hand side starts smaller (as it does when <span class="process-math">\(n = 5\)</span>), it will never catch up. Now the formal proof:</p>

<p id="jys">With great power, comes great responsibility. Induction isn't magic. It seems very powerful to be able to assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true.

Not really. We assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true only for the sake of proving that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true.</p>
<p id="PFB">Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction.

Now consider an arbitrary group of <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> Canadians. The first <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of these must all have the same eye color, since <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. Also, the last <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of these must have the same eye color, since <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true.

<p id="zrk">At first, this question might seem impossible. Perhaps I meant to ask for the <em class="emphasis">smallest</em> number of breaks needed? Let's investigate.</p>
<p id="fyt">Start with some small cases. If <span class="process-math">\(n=2\text{,}\)</span> you must have a <span class="process-math">\(1\times 2\)</span> rectangle, which can be reduced to single pieces in one break. With <span class="process-math">\(n=3\text{,}\)</span> we must have a <span class="process-math">\(1\times 3\)</span> bar, which requires two breaks: the first break creates a single square and a <span class="process-math">\(1\times 2\)</span> bar, which we know takes one (more) break.</p>
<p id="LFC">What about <span class="process-math">\(n=4\text{?}\)</span> Now we could have a <span class="process-math">\(2\times 2\)</span> bar, or a <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 4\)</span> bar. In the first case, break the bar into two <span class="process-math">\(2\times 2\)</span> bars, each which require one more break (that's a total of three breaks required). If we started with a <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 4\)</span> bar, we have choices for our first break. We could break the bar in half, creating two <span class="process-math">\(1\times 2\)</span> bars, or we could break off a single square, leaving a <span class="process-math">\(1\times 3\)</span> bar. But either way, we still need two more breaks, giving a total of three.</p>

<p id="msY">Given a <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-square rectangular chocolate bar, it always takes <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> breaks to reduce the bar to single squares.</p></article><p id="XTU">It makes sense to prove this by induction because after breaking the bar once, you are left with <em class="emphasis">smaller</em> chocolate bars. Reducing to smaller cases is what induction is all about. We can inductively assume we already know how to deal with these smaller bars. The problem is, if we are trying to prove the inductive case about a <span class="process-math">\((k+1)\)</span>-square bar, we don't know that after the first break the remaining bar will have <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> squares. So we really need to assume that our conjecture is true for all cases less than <span class="process-math">\(k+1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="Ebd">Is it valid to make this stronger assumption? Remember, in induction we are attempting to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> What if that were not the case? Then there would be some first <span class="process-math">\(n_0\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(P(n_0)\)</span> was false. Since <span class="process-math">\(n_0\)</span> is the <em class="emphasis">first</em> counterexample, we know that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \lt n_0\text{.}\)</span> Now we proceed to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(n_0)\)</span> is actually true, based on the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all smaller <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="kim">This is quite an advantage: we now have a stronger inductive hypothesis.  We can assume that <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P(2)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P(3)\text{,}\)</span> … <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true, just to show that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true.

<p id="cDN">Let's prove our conjecture about the chocolate bar puzzle:</p>
<article class="proof" id="mOx"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h4>
<p id="BBW">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement, “it takes <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> breaks to reduce a <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-square chocolate bar to single squares.”</p>
<p id="hJf">Base case: Consider <span class="process-math">\(P(2)\text{.}\)</span> The squares must be arranged into a <span class="process-math">\(1\times 2\)</span> rectangle, and we require <span class="process-math">\(2-1 = 1\)</span> breaks to reduce this to single squares.</p>
<p id="NQo">Inductive case: Fix an arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(n\ge 2\)</span> and assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(k \lt n\text{.}\)</span> Consider a <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-square rectangular chocolate bar.

<p id="tXx">We also know that <span class="process-math">\(a \lt n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b \lt n\text{,}\)</span> so by our inductive hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(P(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P(b)\)</span> are true. To reduce the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>-square bar to single squares takes <span class="process-math">\(a-1\)</span> breaks; to reduce the <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>-square bar to single squares takes <span class="process-math">\(b-1\)</span> breaks. Doing this results in our original bar being reduced to single squares. All together it took the initial break, plus the <span class="process-math">\(a-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b-1\)</span> breaks, for a total of <span class="process-math">\(1+a-1+b-1 = a+b-1 = n-1\)</span> breaks.

<p id="UZo"> As a final contrast between the two forms of induction, consider once more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps). We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we could show <em class="emphasis">five</em> base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents (we would actually say how each of these is made).
