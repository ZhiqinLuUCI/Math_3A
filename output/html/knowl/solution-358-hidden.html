<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><p>We have that <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,4}\)</span> has 7 vertices and 12 edges (each vertex in the group of 3 has degree 4). Then by Euler's formula we have that <span class="process-math">\(7 - 12 + f = 2\)</span> so if the graph were planar, it would have <span class="process-math">\(f = 7\)</span> faces. However, since the girth of the graph is 4 (there are no cycles of length 3) we get that <span class="process-math">\(4f \le 2e\text{.}\)</span> But this would mean that <span class="process-math">\(28 \le 24\text{,}\)</span> a contradiction.</p></div></body>
