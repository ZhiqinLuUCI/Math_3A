<p> Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the <em class="emphasis">Pythagorean Theorem</em>. Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as “<span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span>” This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables? So <span class="process-math">\(1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2\text{???}\)</span> How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are the legs of a right triangle and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the hypotenuse. In other words:</p>
