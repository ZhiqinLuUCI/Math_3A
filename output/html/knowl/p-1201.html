<p>This works for this one example. Will it always work? Think about what we are doing here. We want to know how many things are either in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> (or both). We can throw in everything in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and everything in <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> This would give <span class="process-math">\(\card{A} + \card{B}\)</span> many elements. But of course when you actually take the union, you do not repeat elements that are in both. So far we have counted every element in <span class="process-math">\(A \cap B\)</span> exactly twice: once when we put in the elements from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and once when we included the elements from <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> We correct by subtracting out the number of elements we have counted twice. So we added them in twice, subtracted once, leaving them counted only one time.</p>
